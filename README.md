# Repeated Prisoner's Dilemma Game - simulation of agent based model - in C
This is the base model in which the agent responds to the previous outcome of each round. I build this to later build upon it another extended version where agents can have an initial phase of testing the opponents. I would like to see what behavior emerge when they are able to sustain cooperation in society.
# Mini database of structs in .bin
In each cycle, I would save the struct of the agents into a binary file, then I would write interface to get back from this database the agents.
